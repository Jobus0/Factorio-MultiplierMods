TechnologyPriceMultiplier-price-factor=Price factor
TechnologyPriceMultiplier-price-exponent-factor=Price growth factor of infinite tech
TechnologyPriceMultiplier-price-tier-scaling-factor=Price tier scaling factor

[mod-setting-description]
TechnologyPriceMultiplier-price-factor=Adjusts the final science pack cost of all technologies, including infinite technologies. A factor of 0.5 means all technologies cost half as much.
TechnologyPriceMultiplier-price-exponent-factor=Adjusts the exponential growth curve for the science pack cost of infinite technologies. A factor of 0.5 means the cost of infinite technologies will increase half as much per level.
TechnologyPriceMultiplier-price-tier-scaling-factor=Exponentially increases technology cost for each new science pack tier required. A factor of 2 results in costs of 2x, 4x, 8x, etc., for each subsequent tier. Can go below 1.0 for the inverse effect.
