[mod-setting-description]
RobotPowerMultiplier-robot-max-energy-factor=Higher factor means robots can travel farther before needing to recharge, but take more time to recharge at roboports.
RobotPowerMultiplier-robot-charging-energy-factor=Higher factor means robots recharge faster at roboports.
RobotPowerMultiplier-robot-movement-energy-consumption-factor=Lower factor makes robots consume less energy, making them able to fly farther before needing to recharge.
RobotPowerMultiplier-robot-speed-factor=Higher factor means the robot moves faster, but will still consume the same amount of energy per meter, so it doesn't affect maximum travel distance.
RobotPowerMultiplier-robot-approach-distance-factor=Lower factor makes robots wait closer to the roboport while queueing, leading to overall faster recharging.
