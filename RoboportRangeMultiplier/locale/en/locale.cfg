RoboportRangeMultiplier-personal-construction-range-factor=Adjusts the construction range of personal roboport equipment.
RoboportRangeMultiplier-radar-range-factor=At 1.0, the radar range scales to cover both the logistics and construction areas, rounded up in chunks. Adjust this factor if you want the radar range to be larger/smaller than those areas. At 0, roboports will have no radar.
